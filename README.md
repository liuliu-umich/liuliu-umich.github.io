## Projects
### Heart Drug Target Detector
- To identify drug targets for heart disease treatment, led a team of 3 data scientists and implemented a Heart Drug Target Detector to find rare drug targets from 1.4 billion candidates.
- Extracted data from 8 million articles. Customized Data Augmentation and Sampling approaches using domain knowledge. Generated features using NLP and LLM techniques. Applied Boruta and mRMR for feature selection. Trained and optimized models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, CNN, etc.).
- Applied SHAP for insight extraction. Used Active Learning to improve model performance.
- Achieved a precision score of 0.91 with an XGBoost model, nine-fold better than trial-and-error methods.
- Identified 10 novel drug targets. Reduced resource costs by 90% and time requirements by 50% through model deployment as a Flask app on AWS.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
