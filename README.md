## Projects
### Heart Drug Target Detector
- To identify drug targets for heart disease treatment, led a team of 3 data scientists and implemented a Heart Drug Target Detector to find rare drug targets from 1.4 billion candidates.
- Extracted data from 8 million articles. Customized Data Augmentation and Sampling approaches using domain knowledge. Generated features using NLP and LLM techniques. Applied Boruta and mRMR for feature selection. Trained and optimized models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, CNN, etc.).
- Applied SHAP for insight extraction. Used Active Learning to improve model performance.
- Achieved a precision score of 0.91 with an XGBoost model, nine-fold better than trial-and-error methods.
- Identified 10 novel drug targets. Reduced resource costs by 90% and time requirements by 50% through model deployment as a Flask app on AWS.

### Heart Attack Detector
- To identify high-risk individuals for heart attacks, developed a Heart Attack Detector using health data.
- Integrated data from a local hospital database and web scraping. Derived features using historical survival analysis models. Trained multiple classification models (KNN, XGBoost, Artificial Neural Network, etc.).
- Achieved a recall score of 0.81 with XGBoost model, with a 10% improvement over industry benchmark.

### Insight Engine for Heart Regeneration Genes
- To identify gene targets promoting heart regeneration, developed a bioinformatics data analysis pipeline.
- Collected RNA-seq data. Performed Quality Control, Read Mapping and Quantification for data preprocessing. Applied bioinformatics analysis to extract insights.
